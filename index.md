**Building a simple chat-bot using Microsoft's MetaLWOz dataset:** Briefly, my implementation took into account:
      
      • (1) Data pre-processing. Prepare the training data (pairs of sentences from the provided data set).

      • (2) Neural Network Structure. Choosing an appropriate neural network structure that can model the problem.

      • (3) Loss Function. Selecting an appropriate loss function.

      • (4) Training. Training of the model on sentence pairs ([input, output]).

      • (5) Testing - Inference. A txt as well as a gif are provided with some test conversations with the chatbot.
