**Building a simple chat-bot using Microsoft's MetaLWOz dataset** 
#### Briefly, my implementation took into account:

  • **(1) Data pre-processing.** Prepare the training data (pairs of sentences from the provided data set).
  
  • **(2) Neural Network Structure.** Choosing an appropriate neural network structure that can model the problem.
  
  • **(3) Loss Function.** Selecting an appropriate loss function.
  
  • **(4) Training.** Training of the model on sentence pairs ([input, output]).
  
  • **(5) Testing - Inference.** A txt as well as a gif are provided with some test conversations with the chatbot.

**TSP Parser:** With the help of tsplib95 a complete parser was made to read instances of type TSP, HCP, ATSP, SOP, CVRP. Also it supports Edge_Weight_Types of EXPLICIT, EUC_2D, EUC_3D, XRAY1, XRAY2, GEO, ATT, UPPER_ROW, LOWER_ROW and many more. Main goal of this parser is to return important information about a selected problem in order to apply heuristics and metaheuristics later. It is important to mention that this work was part of a group project and my part was about Hamiltonian Cycle Problems (HCP). Contributors are mentioned inside the files.
